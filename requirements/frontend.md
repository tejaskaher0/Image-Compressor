UI Requirements
1. Layout

    The layout should mimic TinyPNG, featuring a clean, minimalistic design.
    Include a header with the application name and a brief description of its functionality.
    A main area for image upload and display.

2. Image Upload

    Implement a drag-and-drop area for file uploads.
    Include an "Upload" button to select files from the local system.
    Support multiple file formats: JPEG, PNG, WEBP.

3. Image Display

    After uploading, display the original image alongside the compressed version.
    Show file size before and after compression.

4. Compression Controls

    Provide options for users to adjust compression quality (e.g., using a slider).
    Display estimated output size based on selected quality.

5. Enhancement Features

    Basic enhancement options such as brightness, contrast, and saturation adjustments.
    Allow users to preview changes before applying them.

6. Download Options

    Provide a download button for the compressed image.
    Optionally allow users to download the enhanced version.

7. Responsive Design

    Ensure the UI is responsive and works well on various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

Backend Requirements
1. Image Compression Library

    Use browser-image-compression or react-image-file-resizer for client-side image compression.
        browser-image-compression: This library supports multiple formats (JPEG, PNG, WEBP) and allows for adjustable quality settings. It is fast and efficient for web applications1

        .
        Installation:

        bash
        npm install browser-image-compression

Example usage:

javascript
import imageCompression from 'browser-image-compression';

const compressImage = async (file) => {
    const options = {
        maxSizeMB: 1,
        maxWidthOrHeight: 1920,
        useWebWorker: true,
    };
    try {
        const compressedFile = await imageCompression(file, options);
        return compressedFile;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error compressing image:', error);
    }
};

2. API Endpoints

    Create RESTful API endpoints to handle image uploads and processing:
        POST /api/upload: Accepts an image file, compresses it using the chosen library, and returns the compressed image.
        GET /api/download/:filename: Provides a link to download the processed image.

3. Storage

    Store uploaded images temporarily on the server or in cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3) for processing.
    Ensure that images are deleted after processing to save space.

4. Error Handling

    Implement error handling for file uploads (e.g., unsupported formats, large file sizes).
    Provide user feedback in case of errors during upload or processing.

Additional Considerations

    Ensure compliance with web accessibility standards (WCAG).
    Implement user authentication if necessary for tracking user uploads or providing additional features.
    Optimize performance by loading images asynchronously and minimizing server response times.
